TPS 2
1) gcc -g punishment.c -o punish
2) gdb punish
3) r
4) A breakpoint is a point in the code that the execution stops so that you can continue to debug it during runtime. b <line of code or function name>. 
5) s
6) print <var name>
7) c
8) q

TPS 3
1) 4, px and py are pointers
2) their values will be garbage
3) initialize the variables
4) printf(&x, &y)
5) px = x, py = y;, printf(&px ,&py)

Assignment 1
1) line 23
2) put an & before input on line 15
3) the values of values and sum are not returned when read_values finishes, so they remain 0 and give the average as 0
4) the way to fix the bug is to define a struct with values and sum, then change read_values to type struct

Assignment 2
1) yes, it prints "HELLO!hello!".
2) no, it prints "HI!hi!hello!". The bug is that the program doesn't delete the string before going through the loop again.
3) no, it prints "thank you!I am fine, thank you!". This occurs due to the gets() function. str1 and str2 are only 10 characters long, but gets() doesn't check length.
