TPS 1
1) A component that stores data so that future requests for that data 
	can be served faster
4) 4 bits for offset, offset scales as the number of bits required to 
	represent n-1 bytes of block size. 1 byte is not practical.

5) 6 bits are required to represent 64 blocks.  Index bits scale as the number
	of bits required to represent n-1 blocks.
6) Yes, multiply the block size by the number of blocks
7) Remmaining bits are stored as the tag which are used to ensure the correct data is stored when called
8) 
	a) 1,048,575 addresses
	b) 3 bits
	c) 16 blocks
	d) 4 bits
	e) 16 bits
	g) 50 bits
	
TPS 2
1) Because blocks of main memory map to specific locations in cache, data could
	be continually re-referenced and blocks swapped in and out, causing a lot
	of inefficiency
3) 8 index bits for 256 sets. you need enough index bits to represent n-1 sets of m blocks
4) 
	a) 1,048,575 addresses
	b) 3 offset bits
	c) 16 blocks
	d) 8 sets
	e) 3 index bits
	f) 17 bits
	h) 53 bits

Assignemnt 1
1) 4 caches, there is a separate L1 for data and instructions
2) L1 is 32 KBytes, L2 is 256 KBytes, L3 is 8 MBytes
3) The block size for all caches is 64-bytes
4) L1 is 8-way set associative, L2 is 4-way set associative, and L3 is 16-way set associative
5) 8 index bits, 6 offset bits, 56 tag bits
